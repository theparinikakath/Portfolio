            I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> with a strong eye for clean, accessible, and modern UI/UX. Over the past few years, 
            I've built a range of full-stack projects like Caring Hands, a donation website. 
            I have also built various frontend projects like an Admin Dashboard, a weather app, and a simple quiz game. 
            I'm passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces that make a lasting impression 
            and solve real-world problems.
            <br /><br />
            I've also developed my own versions of popular platforms like Quora and WhatsApp (feel free to check out my GitHub ðŸ˜Š).
            <br /><br />
            I'm also an active <strong>problem solver</strong>, with 600+ problems solved across LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. 
            I actively participate in coding contests and have recently started competing on Codeforces.
